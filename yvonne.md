Last Friday i didn't attend the the lab sessions
i had to listen to the recordings and do the labs
Athough very long but very interesting.
Thank you Theo and the entire Wirfon-lab family for 
your time and dedication. 
Quite undstanding yvonne, you are a motivation.
I noticed your file "yvonne" does not have the .md extension good to know that github accepts it!

Git is a great Source control tool to work with especially when intergrated with Terraform. I love working with git.
